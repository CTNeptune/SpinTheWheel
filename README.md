# SpinTheWheel
An example of spinning a wheel that grants prizes in Unity 3D 2018.4.12f1. It's a complete project that should compile out-of-the-box.

Features:
- Custom inspector for easily adding/removing wheel items
- Can spin either clockwise or counterclockwise
- Animations can be tweaked in the inspector
- Simulates 1000 spins and displays the results in the console
- Winning item properties can be plugged into API of your choice (this example just adds the item's value to a text mesh's value)
